# Product Requirements Doc Template for thin-edge.io

## How to use the product requirements document (PRD)?

 - For all bigger ideas, problems, feature requests a PRD should be inititally populated, answering as much as

**Template (with slide modifications) by  [Lenny Rachitsky](https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/) . For advice on using the template, [read this post](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-solve-problems-6bf14222e424?sk=7d60d49dd3f7feb571b108e2ca515824).**

## Description: What is it?

This is just a brief description of what you’re thinking, so that folks reading this doc can quickly grok what this idea/feature/problem/opportunity is all about. Keep it brief.

## Problem: What problem is this solving?

The problem statement itself is foundational so spend extra time there. Think of the problem like a hypothesis. What do you believe the problem you are solving is, and why? You’ll add more context later. Key attributes of a strong problem statement include:

1.  **It’s short.** Aim for a single sentence to describe the actual problem. The more you need to explain it, the less clear the problem ends up being.
2.  **It’s focused.**  It includes just a single clear problem that can be owned by a single team and solved in a reasonable amount of time. It’s often very helpful to add some examples of what problem you are *not* solving.
3.  **It references a “need” that is not being fulfilled.**  Try to focus this around a user need, but can also be a business need if necessary. The  [Jobs-To-Be-Done framework](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)  is especially useful here.
4.  **It includes a what and a why.**  What’s going wrong, and why is it a problem? You’ll need to back this up in the next section.
5.  **It’s agnostic of a solution.**  Resist the urge to jump to a solution this early.

Examples of good problem statements:

-   Lyft drivers are cancelling rides too often because the passengers are too far away.
-   Airbnb hosts are feeling frustrated because they want to improve, but are finding it difficult to figure out how.
-   Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow.

Examples of bad problem statements:

-   User growth is slowing. [Issue: Too broad for this process, see advice on approaching big picture strategy  [here](http://boz.com/articles/strategy-tactics.html)  and  [here](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SUB4MWG7602M&keywords=good+strategy+bad+strategy&qid=1554495219&s=gateway&sprefix=good+strategy+bad%2Caps%2C204&sr=8-1). Also not user-centric.]
-   Build a loyalty program. [Issue: Assumes a solution. What’s the problem this is solving?]
-   Users are bouncing from the signup flow. [Issue: Not focused enough, and missing a hypothesis of the why. Go one level deeper.]

## Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?

This is where you collect evidence backing up your problem statement, aka hypothesis. What initially convinced you that this was a problem? What makes it clear to you that this problem needs to be tackled?

Sometimes at this step you realize this problem isn’t actually worth prioritizing right now, or that you need to adjust how you think about the problem. That’s the whole point of this exercise, so don’t resist it. There are infinite problems to tackle — your goal is to feel confident that this problem is worth your team’s time right now.

A few tips for this step:

1.  **Look at both quantitative and qualitative evidence.**  Collect all data points that point to this being a real and important problem.
2.  **Quality over quantity.** Three to five strong data points is far better than a dozen tangentially related points. Your case ends up being weaker with too many items because often you end up filling it with minor and unrelated data points to make it look like a lot of evidence. Your case doesn’t have to be perfect or air-tight.
3.  **Play devil’s advocate with yourself.**  Try to convince yourself that this isn’t actually a real or big enough problem. What gaps do you have in your evidence? Is the evidence truly telling you what you think? Push yourself here.

In the end it’ll be judgement call amongst many tradeoffs. Your job is to make the best case you can with the data you have. Continue refining the problem statement as you learn more.

## Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?

Did you achieve what you set out to achieve? How will you know? Answer that question and write it down in this section.

This criteria becomes incredibly important throughout the project because it helps you make decisions and prioritize. Does feature X increase the chances of achieving the goal you set? If not, cut it.

Ideally this is a specific metric, with a defined goal, that you can easily measure. 

If you don’t think a metric makes sense for your goal (think long and hard about this), write out what concretely the world would look like if this was a big success. Make that the success criteria.

## Audience: Who are we building for?

who’s it for? Specific is generally better here and doesn’t need to be contained to just end-users, depending on your product it may even be internal users for platform/internal product teams. Be very clear on which target groups you address 

## What: What does this look like in the product?

This is where you take a shot at describing the solution to the problem. Depending on the way your team operates, and how much is already known, this can be very high level or very detailed.
